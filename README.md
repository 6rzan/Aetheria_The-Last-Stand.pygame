# Aetheria: The Last Stand

## Purpose of the Game

The objective of "Aetheria: The Last Stand" is to defend the Heartcrystal from waves of shadow creatures. You must strategically place magical towers along a path to defeat the enemies before they reach the Heartcrystal. You win the game by surviving all the waves. You lose if the Heartcrystal's health reaches zero.

## How to Play

1.  **Run the game:** Execute the `main.py` file to start the game.
    ```
    python main.py
    ```

2.  **Select a Tower:** On the right side of the screen, you will see a UI panel with three different towers:
    *   **Sunfire Spire (Orange):** Shoots a single, high-damage projectile.
    *   **Frost Spire (Light Blue):** Fires a beam that slows enemies.
    *   **Storm Spire (Purple):** Deals area-of-effect (AOE) damage.

    Click on the icon of the tower you wish to build.

3.  **Place the Tower:** After selecting a tower, click on one of the designated green circles on the map to place it. You can only place towers on these spots. Each tower has a cost, which will be deducted from your currency.

4.  **Earn Currency:** You earn currency by defeating enemies. Use this currency to build more towers.

5.  **Survive the Waves:** Enemies will spawn in waves of increasing difficulty. Survive all the waves to win the game.
