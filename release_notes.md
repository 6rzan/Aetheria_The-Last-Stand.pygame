# Aetheria: The Last Stand - Release Notes

Welcome to the world of Aetheria! This document outlines the current state of the game, detailing all the features, recent changes, and what you can expect from this tower defense experience.

## Game Overview

The objective of "Aetheria: The Last Stand" is to defend the Heartcrystal from waves of shadow creatures. You must strategically place magical towers along a path to defeat the enemies before they reach the Heartcrystal. You win the game by surviving all the waves. You lose if the Heartcrystal's health reaches zero.

## Key Features

*   **Strategic Tower Defense:** Place a variety of towers on designated plots to counter incoming enemy waves.
*   **Diverse Tower Arsenal:**
    *   **Sunfire Spire:** A powerful single-target damage dealer.
    *   **Frost Spire:** A utility tower that slows down enemies with a beam.
    *   **Storm Spire:** An area-of-effect tower perfect for handling groups of enemies.

    *   **Aetherium (Permanent):** Converted from your leftover Shards at the end of each wave. Use this to purchase new towers, plots, and permanent upgrades.
*   **Meta-Progression:** Your Aetherium is saved between games! Amass wealth to grow stronger over time. An "Armory" feature is planned for future updates to expand on this.

## Recent Updates

The game has undergone several major phases of development to bring it to its current state:

### Visual Polish & Scaling Overhaul (Phase 3)
The most recent update focused on visual fidelity and player experience. All placeholder graphics have been replaced with final, high-quality assets for towers, enemies, and the environment. The entire game world, including the path and all gameplay elements, has been scaled up for better visibility. We've also reworked the path rendering to create a more visually appealing textured look.

### Economic Overhaul & Dynamic Difficulty (Phase 2)
This update introduced the strategic dual-currency system (Shards and Aetherium) and the meta-progression framework. The ability to choose a difficulty for each level was also added, providing more control over the challenge.

### UI/UX and Gameplay Overhaul (Phase 1)
This was a foundational update that transformed the game from a prototype into a full-featured experience. It introduced the modern three-panel layout, the centered map view, tower upgrading and selling, the "Healer" enemy, multiple levels, and crucial game controls like pause, fast-forward, and settings.
